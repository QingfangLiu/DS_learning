# ML & DL Learning Notebooks

This repository contains Jupyter notebooks from my journey learning machine learning and deep learning methods. Each notebook explores a concept, paper, or model, often built from scratch or following a tutorial, with added comments and visualizations.

### Topics include:
- Optimization methods (Adam, SGD, etc.)
- Variational Autoencoders (VAEs)
- Attention and Transformers
- Graph Neural Networks (GNNs)
- Miscellaneous ML/DL concepts
